Voronoi Tesselations
--------------------
Inspired by: ESLII_print12 (Hastie) discussion of Nearest Neighbors (2.3.2)
  
Task: Create code to randomly seed 2D space with points and create polygons based on euclidean distance to seeded points
  
Extensions: 
  - Extend to 3D space and visualize static slices
  - Visualize dynamic slices of 3D space to "move" through tesselations
  - Use customizable distance calculations: euclidean, manhattan, other?
Stretch:
  - Use Scala instead of Python
